## SUMMARY

Our project aims to create a facial skin condition detection app, especially regarding skin problems such as acne, dark circle, wrinkle, and normal. Many people have diculty in recognizing their skin condition and choosing appropriate skincare products, which can risk using inappropriate ingredients and worsening skin conditions. This can lead to frustration, wasted money, and prolonged skin problems.

Our solution addresses this problem by utilizing Machine Learning to analyze facial skin
conditions from images and provide skincare ingredient recommendations that match the
detected skin conditions. We created an app that can accurately analyze skin conditions
and provide scientically-based skincare ingredient recommendations to reduce people
experimenting with skincare products. Our team chose this project to address the need for
an easily accessible skincare guide, especially for users who have limited knowledge of skin
and skincare. By providing more accurate skincare information and advice, we hope users
can make beer skincare choices, improving their skin health and condence.
